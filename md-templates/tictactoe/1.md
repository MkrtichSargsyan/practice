### Hello Shoira Toshpulatova


Good job with the changes you made after the last review :+1:,
However, there are some changes that you need to make in order to get your project approved

- [ ] user input should be validated so it's not empty. ( users should not be able to create an empty username)
  Kindly add a function which will check if the user input is not empty,othervise ask user to enter valid user name )



Please, make the REQUIRED changes and submit your request again! :grinning:
Good luck.
