## _Status:_  Changes Requested :recycle:

### Hello Guys


Good job with the changes you made after the last review :+1:,
However, there are some changes that you need to make in order to get your project approved

- [ ] user input should be validated so it's not empty. ( users should not be able to create an empty username)
  Kindly add a function that will check if the user input is not empty, otherwise ask the user to enter a valid user name )

- [ ] Game informs player if the selected move is a winning move (without computing the winning move) [Example screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/ruby/OOP/milestone2/game_win%2059.png)

- [ ] Game informs player if the selected move is a draw move (without computing draw).[Example screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/ruby/OOP/milestone2/game_tie.png)

- [ ] A loop is needed in this game (recommended is a while loop) [OdinProject hint](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/ruby/OOP/milestone2/loop.png)

  >Inside the loop, you should call actions repeated for each move
  >Use some condition to control the loop

      ex
  
      game_on = true
  
      while game_on
      # loop for each move
        if winner # and/or draw (the exact condition in this milestone is not important)
          game_on = false
        end
      end




Please, make the REQUIRED changes and submit your request again! :grinning:
Good luck.
