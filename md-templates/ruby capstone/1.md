Please use the correct git-flow
No need of using attr_reader :greeting, :token, :order, :suggestions, :suggest_food, :suggest_drinksÂ in the Raven class, You are not using those variables in other classes

Please don't disable that many rules of rubocop in the raven.rb file

I couldn't understand why did you inherit the Suggestions class from the Order class. No need for an inheritance, in this case, it works the same way without using inheritance.

You have a repeating message in the @suggestions.food_drinks_suggestion_accepted method of Raven class
