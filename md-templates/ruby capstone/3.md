Hello, `Verissimo Henry` ðŸ‘‹ Congratulations on finishing the ruby section of the Microverse.

1. The project is clear
3. You have descriptive git commit messages.


no description for the pull request

1. There is unnecessary attribute accessors in your linters.rb file
  ```attr_reader :file_path, :content, :file_lines, :errors```
  you are not using that variables in other classes


2. Your code structure could greatly be improved. Make use of OOP. Think in terms of having a ruby-linter object for example which will hold all the checking methods (count_ends trailing_white_spaces, empty_line)

3. If you write two functions together, it could not find the error
ex. 

def my_method
  puts 'Welcome'
end
def method
  puts 'Welcome'
end

4. Your pull request is not descriptive
