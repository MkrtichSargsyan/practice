Hello, Fernando Marques üëã Congratulations on finishing the ruby section of the Microverse. The project is very professional ‚≠ê .It looks great with everything from a professional README file, to good code organization and use of the best practices. Especially I like the idea of automatically tweeting news from the Medium website.

1. There is unnecessary attribute accessors in your cart.rb file
  ``` attr_reader :content, :companies ```
  ``` attr_reader :raw_data ```
  ``` attr_accessor :selected_data, :company_categories ```
  ``` attr_accessor :filter ```
  you are not using that variables in other classes

2. In your README file you didn't mention how to search for your telegram bot.Kindly add this to your README instructions.


- On your telegram account search for :
  ```
   @pizzamvcapstone_bot

   ``` 
- Then press the /START button and follow the steps given

Hello, Carlos Osorio üëã Congratulations on finishing the ruby section of the Microverse.The app runs as expected.

1. The unit tests cover both positive and negative test case scenarios
2. The project solves the problem it was supposed to solve.
3. Your PR has a good title and description.
4. You have descriptive git commit messages.




1. There is unnecessary attribute accessors in all your classes
  ``` attr_reader :content, :companies ```
  ``` attr_reader :raw_data ```
  ``` attr_accessor :selected_data, :company_categories ```
  ``` attr_accessor :filter ```
  you are not using that variables in other classes

2. Kindly make develop branch as default

3. Create different files for every class with the same name

4. Your code structure could greatly be improved. Thinking in terms of having an "organization" object for example which will hold only data you need about the given organization.
