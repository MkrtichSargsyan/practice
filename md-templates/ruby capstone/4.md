Hello, Zeenat Lawal ðŸ‘‹ Congratulations on finishing the ruby section of the Microverse.
I like your project idea.

1. The project is clear.
2. Your PR has a good title and description.
3. You have descriptive git commit messages.

Here are some changes to make and improve on

Getting the token is not clear. In your READMEÂ file, you need to add more details about where to put the token.

The filename and module name should be the same. eg. the Scrapper module should have scrapper.rb naming

Please don't disable that many rules of rubocop in the bot.rb file

There are no attribute accessors and private methods for data encapsulation.

Your code structure could greatly be improved. Make use of OOP.
ex. You can create a Message class where you hold all the functions.Â After calling that functions in the bot.rb file depending on the command that the user inputs.
