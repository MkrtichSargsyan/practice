You can go ahead and merge this branch to the base branch of this repo.

Your project certainly is working fine.


Remember about descriptive README file - feel free to use this template:

There is some changes that have to be made to approve the project:

Once done with the changes, please ask for another code review.


Using Inline Styles is probably one of the worst CSS practices that many web designers and developers are still doing to this day. It transgresses the main goal of why we use CSS â€“ which is to separate style from the HTML structure. This breaks the specificity of web pages

 Please use mobile-first approach while developing the website
The use of a max-width media query reflects that you are not following the mobile-first approach. Mobile-first is when we start by writing our CSS for mobile devices and then use media queries to add styling for larger screen sizes.
