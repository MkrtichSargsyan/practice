## _Status:_ Approved  :hamster: :rocket:
Hi Guys.

Congratulations on your hard work, your project is now approved, 

> Your readme file explicitly tells how to start the game
> and also explains rules of the game


## OPTIONAL
It would be nice if you create a live demo on [repl.id](https://replit.com/) and put that in your README.md file.

You can go ahead and merge this branch to the base branch of this repo.

Good luck in your future projects and happy coding :relaxed:
