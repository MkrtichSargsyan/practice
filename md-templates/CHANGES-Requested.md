## Hello Guys

THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE WORK. YOU HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB :+1:

Good job on implementing the changes requested. However, there are some changes that you need to make in order to get your project approved

-[] user input should be validated so it's not empty.

-[] Game should informs player if the selected move is a winning move. [Example screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/ruby/OOP/milestone2/game_win%2059.png) 

<hr>

## OPTIONAL

-[] instead of using ``` print "\n" ``` in order to add newline you can use ``` puts ```

Please, make the REQUIRED changes and submit your request again! :grinning:
Good luck.
