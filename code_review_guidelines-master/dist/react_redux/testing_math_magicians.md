# Description

This project is all about testing. Students reuse Math Magicians website they built in the [previous exercise](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/react-redux-v11/184438/path/step/106376017/) and add set of tests to it.

# Minimum Requirements Checklist

**As there is a chance that as a TSE you haven't completed this project, please complete the following steps first:**

- check [description of Math Magicians website](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/react-redux-v11/184438/path/step/106376017/), take a look at mockups attached to them
- complete lesson about [React testing](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/react-redux-v11/184438/path/step/106478125/)
- read [testing Math Magicians requirements](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/react-redux-v11/184438/path/step/106580952/) carefully!

Review time for this project accomodates these additional steps.

To consider the project 'complete' it must satisfy the following points:

- [ ] all functionalities are tested using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), `@testing-library/react`, see the [screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/react_reducx/testing/useReactTestingLibrary.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/react-redux-v11/184438/path/step/106580952/).
- [ ] all functions in calculate.js file are covered with unit tests
- [ ] there are snapshot tests that are checking if the main components, at least Home, Calculator, and Quote, from Math Magicians mockups are displayed

**Common mistakes:**
- check snapshots section in the command line test dashboard and ensure that all snapshots are up to date and none is obsolete.

### Project Specification Shortcut (**requirements from Odin**)

### Additional Microverse Requirements (Pathwright)

#### General

Please [check here for general requirements](../general_minimum_crucial_list.md)

#### Section specific

Please [check here for section specific requirements](./section_minimum_crucial_list.md)

- [ ] **state should only be used for attributes of a Component that needs to be altered at some point in time**, since state increases complexity and reduces predictability, a Component without state is preferable, learn more [here](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md#should-this-component-have-state) (See [screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/react_reducx/section/reactStateProps.png) from [pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/94832148/))
