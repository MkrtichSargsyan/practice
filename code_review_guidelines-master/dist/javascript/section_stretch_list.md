- [ ] Students should not overuse ESLint disable comments, ie: `eslint-ignore <rule-to-be-ignored>`.
  - Disabling rules multiple times in the same file, or disabling easy to fix rules such as `no-console`, `no-alert`, or `no-var` should be avoided.
  - Disabling rules for situations that are hard to fix, for example, disabling `no-unused-expressions` when separating logic in multiple scripts before the WebPack lesson, should be ok.
  - Eslint rules are meant to catch bad code and enforce best practices and the eslintrc provided by [Microverse linters repo](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/javascript/.eslintrc.json) doesn't enforce strict rules.
  - By disabling ESLint rules, the student is suppressing the potential warnings theyâ€™d be getting, missing out on the education that ESLint rules provide.
