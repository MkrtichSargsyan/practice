- [ ] Ensure that students work with Git Flow: production `master` branch + main `develop` branch + Pull Requests from feature branches to the `develop` ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/git_flow_requirement.png) from Pathwright)
- [ ] Node modules - .lock files should be in the repository to avoid problems with future versions of the dependencies. It also helps to keep the same versions in different installations of the app (production, development, etc...) ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/lock_files_requirement.png) from Pathwright)
- [ ] No `console.log` commited to repo. It's ugly, it kills performance. and it can make confidential data be visible in the browser tools. ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/console_log_requirement.png) from Pathwright)
- [ ] Do not use Window.alert() or Window.confirm(). Itâ€™s ugly, impossible to style, stop code execution and display differently on different browsers. Use custom modal instead. ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/alert_requirement.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/javascript-module-v-10/166782/path/step/97634928/))
- [ ] ES6 - using object destructuring to get the values from an object. This way you can avoid repeating a lot of code. ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/destructuring_requirement.png) from Pathwright)
- [ ] ES6 - Use ES6 introduced in [previous lesson](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/javascript-module-v10-copy/166786/path/step/97635162/)([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/es6_requirement.png)). The only exception is if the project is the Library, when the students still didn't learn about ES6.
- [ ] Keep the application logic separated from DOM manipulation tasks ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/dom_logic_separation_requirement.png) from Pathwright)
- [ ] Keep all the styling logic in CSS files (If you need to change something like a background image, add the classes with the different backgrounds to the CSS and then change the class name attribute with JavaScript) ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/styling_requirement.png) from Pathwright)
- [ ] Keep the number of changes/updates to the DOM as low as possible, they are very expensive for the browser ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/section/dom_updates_requirement.png) from Pathwright)
