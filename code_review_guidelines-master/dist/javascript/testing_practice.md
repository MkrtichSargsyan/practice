# Minimum Requirements Checklist

To consider the project 'complete' it must satisfy the following points:

### Project Specification Shortcut (**requirements from Odin**)

#### `capitalize` ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/testing_practice/capitalize_requirement.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice))

- [ ] `capitalize` is a function that takes a string as an argument and returns that string with the first character capitalized
- [ ] There is a Jest test for the `capitalize` function and it's passing

#### `reverseString` ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/testing_practice/reverse_requirement.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice))

- [ ] `reverseString` is a function that takes a string as an argument and returns that string reversed
- [ ] There is a Jest test for the `reverseString` function and it's passing

#### `calculator` ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/testing_practice/calculator_requirement.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice))

- [ ] It is an object
- [ ] It has an `add` method
- [ ] It has a `subtract`
- [ ] It has a `multiply` method
- [ ] It has a `divide` method
- [ ] There is a Jest test for the `calculator` object that tests the `add`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide` methods

#### Caesar Cipher ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/testing_practice/caesar_requirement.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice))

- [ ] Caesar Cipher is implemented
- [ ] It has a test for wrapping from `z` to `a`
- [ ] It has a test for keeping the same case
- [ ] It has a test for punctuation

#### Array Analysis ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/javascript/testing_practice/array_analysis_requirement.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice))

- [ ] It has a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns an object
- [ ] The returned object has the `average` of the numbers in the array as a property
- [ ] The returned object has the `min` of the numbers in the array as a property
- [ ] The returned object has the `max` of the numbers in the array as a property
- [ ] The returned object has the `length` of the numbers in the array as a property
- [ ] There is a Jest test for function to calculate correctly `average`, `min`, `max` and `length`

### Additional Microverse Requirements (Pathwright)

#### General

Please [check here for general requirements](../general_minimum_crucial_list.md)

#### Section specific

Please [check here for section specific requirements](./section_minimum_crucial_list.md)

#### Project specific

- [ ] Each module/class/factory should have its own file, and each file should have a corresponding test file. For example, there should be a `calculator.test.js` for a `calculator.js` file.
