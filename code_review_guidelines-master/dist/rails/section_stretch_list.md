- [ ] Students should not overuse RuboCop disable cops comments, ie: `# rubocop:disable Layout/LineLength, Layout/SpaceInsideBlockBraces`.
  - Disabling cops multiple lines in the same file, disabling multiple cops at the top of a document, or disabling easy to fix cops such as `Layout/LineLength`, `Style/GuardClause`, or `Style/GlobalVars` should be avoided.
  - Disabling cops for situations that are hard to fix, and would require refactoring multiple files, should be ok.
  - RuboCop cops are meant to catch bad code and enforce best practices and the rubocop.yml file provided by [Microverse linters repo](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/ruby/.rubocop.yml) doesn't enforce strict rules.
  - By disabling RuboCop rules, the student is suppressing the potential warnings theyâ€™d be getting, missing out on making their Ruby code more idiomatic.
