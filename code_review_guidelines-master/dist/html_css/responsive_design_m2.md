# Building with Responsive Design - Milestone 2
## Description

In this project, the student replicates the archived version of the website [The Next Web](https://perma.cc/M5ZV-Q2D6). The main goal of the project is to apply responsive design techniques so that the website behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is displayed.

As the main point of this project is to implement a **Responsive Web Design** and learn how to use **flex and grid**, focus on these aspects during the code review.

We have divided the projects into milestones so that you have a good understanding of what you will work on every day. Specifically for this project, we are going to have 2 milestones to be checked by code reviewers. So, at the end of each milestone, you will need to request a new code review.


The guidelines below are for **Milestone 2**. Specifically, in this milestone we also enforce the usage of **CSS grid in at least one section**.
