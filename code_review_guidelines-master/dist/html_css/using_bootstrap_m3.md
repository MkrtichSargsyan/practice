# Using Bootstrap - Milestone 3
## Description

In this project, the students build a replica of the Newsweek website. Specifically, to avoid confusion, they use [this snapshot of the webarchive from January 20, 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/).

The main goal of this project is to learn how to **use the Bootstrap framework**, specifically its responsive design features: you should focus on this aspect during the code review. Also, students are asked to be more precise and to make sure that **their page looks exactly the same as the source page.**

We divided the development of the project in 3 milestones.
Each milestone should only be approved if all the mandatory requirements in the current milestone are fulfilled, else changes should be requested and the student should submit the milestone for a re-review.

**For the last milestone, milestone 3, focus on the milestone requirements but also review the project as a whole (including milestones 1 and 2 mandatory missing requirements if there were any).**


The guidelines below are for **Milestone 3**.
