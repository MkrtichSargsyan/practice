# Description

This assignment consists of making a clone of a [New York Times article page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html).
By this point, the student should be familiar with the concepts of:

- Embedding images
- Working with forms (buttons in this case)
- Positioning elements with float, flex and grid.
- The box model

# Minimum Requirements Checklist

To consider the project 'complete' it must satisfy the following points:

### Project Specification Shortcut (**requirements from Odin**)

#### Page structure

The students should apply the basic HTML5&CSS concepts ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/html_css/positioning_and_floating_elements/positioning_and_floating_requirements.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/59538403/))

##### Navigation bar

- [ ] It has a "Hamburger button", a search icon and a link with text on the leftmost side ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0)) 
- [ ] It has the NY Times image logo embedded in the center ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0)) 
- [ ] The NY Times logo is a link ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))
- [ ] 'Log in' elements on the rightmost side ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))

##### Main Content

- [ ] It contains centered text and images ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))
##### Bottom part

- [ ] It uses an anchor tag, any valid value e.g. "#" is okay for it's `href` attribute, to other articles with image previews on the leftmost side ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))
- [ ] It uses an anchor tag, any valid value e.g. "#" is okay for it's `href` attribute, to more popular articles on the rightmost side ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))

#### Implementation details

##### Navigation bar

- [ ] It should have a fixed position (it sticks to the top part of the screen) ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))

### Additional Microverse Requirements (Pathwright)

#### General

Please [check here for general requirements](../general_minimum_crucial_list.md)

#### Section specific

Please [check here for section specific requirements](./section_minimum_crucial_list.md)

#### Project specific

#### Page structure

- [ ] If page design is messed up because of different display size on student machine and your machine - we can approve this project! Ask the student for display size, so you can check if this is the case.

#### Implementation details

- [ ] Elements aligned with a combination of all three techniques ([float](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/), [flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)). ([Screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/html_css/positioning_and_floating_elements/flex_float_grid_requirement_pathwright.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/59538403/)) and ([Screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/html_css/positioning_and_floating_elements/flex_float_grid_requirement_odin.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements#introduction))
- [ ] It uses [`<aside>` tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_aside.asp) for `Editor's picks` section on the righmost side. ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/html_css/positioning_and_floating_elements/aside_requirement.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/59538403/))
- [ ] Pay attention to **The Theory of Inflation** section - some students bypass requirements here by using screenshots ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))

# [OPTIONAL] Stretch Requirements Checklist & Common issues

You should use these requirements but only with **OPTIONAL** tag  
Thanks to this students can learn more.

Please [check here for stretch requirements](./section_stretch_list.md)

- [ ] The use of absolute positioning for the _editor's picks_ and _subscribe_ sections. The expected outcome can be achieved way more easily with the use of the `<section>` and `<aside>` tags which help keep the document flow.

- [ ] It has a fixed footer (it sticks to the bottom part of the screen) ([link to page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0))
