## Submitted results

In the submission, you received a link to a PR (as in previous projects) and a link to a video with the presentation of the project

## Before your first review

- [ ] Watch these video about [the workflow of reviewing a capstone project](https://www.loom.com/share/95044a2294a44a028050c9d8458ebcb3)(10 minutes) and [how to assess the deadline and final decision](https://www.loom.com/share/bf6cd6c7e8ec4803a5716139daa541dc)(6 minutes)

## Before you start the review

- [ ] Read the project description (choose the project submitted out all the 3 possible projects)
- [ ] Clone the repository and move to the branch of the PR to have the code accessible
- [ ] Watch the video to understand what the project is about

## Marking capstone as invalid

Here are the possible reasons for invalidating a capstone code review request:

- The submitted PR link was wrong
- No content is showing on the webpage
- You cannot run the project (with build/start commands)

If anything from the above happens, open a Zendesk ticket and share the code review request number and grade the project as Incompetence with the following note:

> As I wasn't able to review this project because of _`explain the reason here`_, this code review request will be invalidated.

## Assessment

In the assessment form, you are asked to assess a list of technical and soft skills, using this scale:

- [1] Yes, totally agree
- [2] Yes, but not in all occasions
- [3] No, sometimes but not enough

If you find difficulties answering some of the questions with these guidelines, or you think that something important of the project was not assessed, please leave a comment at the end of the form. If something is urgent, contact directly Israel via [email](mailto:israel@microverse.org) or Zendesk.

### Common mistakes

- Take into account weekend when evaluating deadlines: the students are given 3 working days
- The students are allowed to use Bootstrap in their project, so the questions about margin, padding and flex can get the max score if the students do those things using Bootstrap (not plain CSS)
- In the social network project, Helvetica Neue is a paid font therefore we allow the students to use a similar font like Open Sans (updated in project requirements)
- Title tags: please, double-check there’s one h1 per page!
- Something new I learnt: `flex-flow` is a shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-grow`
- If GitHub Actions is not properly set up, then the student gets a 4 (minimum grade) in the linters question
- If linter config files have been modified, then the student gets a 4 (minimum grade) in the linters question
