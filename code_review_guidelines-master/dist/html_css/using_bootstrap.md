# Description

This project requests students to build a replica of the archived version of the news site [Newsweek.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/) using the Bootstrap framework.
Specifically, they should use [this snapshot of the webarchive from January 20, 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/).

**As the main point of this project is to use Bootstrap, focus on this aspect during the code review.**
**In this project students are asked to be more precise and to make sure that their page looks exactly the same as the source page.**
