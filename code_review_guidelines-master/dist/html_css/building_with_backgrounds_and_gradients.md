# Minimum Requirements Checklist

To consider the project 'complete' it must satisfy the following points:

### Project Specification Shortcut (**requirements from Odin**)

#### Page structure

#### Navbar

- [ ] It should be made of nine different elements with the Apple logo on the leftmost section and a search field on the rightmost section ([link to page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/))
- [ ] The first eight elements should be links (to other sections or `#`), and the search bar should be an `<input>` tag ([link to page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/))

#### Bottom

- [ ] It contains four elements which are links (to other articles or `#`) ([link to page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/))

#### Footer

- [ ] It should be wrapped by `<footer>` tags ([link to page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/))
- [ ] It includes links like copyright, terms of use, and privacy policy ([link to page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/))

#### Implementation details

#### Background

- [ ] The main content should have an image set as background (as CSS [`background-image`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp) or [`background -> url`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.asp)) ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/html_css/building_with_backgrounds_and_gradients/background_image_requirement.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients))
- [ ] The CSS background should `cover` the whole page irrespective of the screen size. This will be a learning opportunity for the students to use the background size and position properties.

#### Navigation background

- [ ] It uses CSS [`background -> gradient`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.asp) for background ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/html_css/building_with_backgrounds_and_gradients/navigation_requirement.png) from [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients))
