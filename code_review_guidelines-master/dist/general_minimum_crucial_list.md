- [ ] Files not related to the project should not be committed and added to .gitignore (e.g. `.DS_Store`) ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/general/gitignore.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/66243643/))
  - `[HINT]` you can mention [this article](https://code.likeagirl.io/how-to-get-rid-of-ds-store-and-node-modules-in-git-repositories-d37b8a391247?gi=515a0c7a0d13) which explains how to add the files to `.gitignore_global` which will prevent them from being added to any future project (unless they change/format the PC).
- [ ] Comments: Itâ€™s better to delete **commented piece of codes**. If you need to review a previous version of your code, use git history ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/general/no_inline_comments.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/66243643/))  
       :x: **commented piece of codes** `/* .nav { color: red;} */`  
       :heavy_check_mark:  **comments about code** `/* Navigation */`         
       Comments about the code is okay and should only be tagged as `OPTIONAL` if it's unnecessary and please provide details about why it is unnecessary.
- [ ] Linters config: Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students. ([screenshot](https://gitlab.com/microverse/guides/projects/requirements_screenshots/raw/master/images/general/linter_config.png) from [Pathwright](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/54883773/) and [Zendesk](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002085202-February-2nd-2021-linter-errors-as-a-reason-of-project-invalidation-))) - Submit as invalid if it is a first review. **[**Caveat**] _Students can ommit linter config (rubocop, stylint, etc) but configs in `.github/workflows/` must be exactly the same, in this case the workflow will use the config in the linter config repo._

> **Reminder:** Specially for the first HTML&CSS projects, remind the students they should not open a new Pull Request for re-reviews. They should use the same Pull Request submitted for the first review unless it is requested otherwise.
